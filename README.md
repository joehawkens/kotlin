# Overview

This is yet another project I created to practice my critical thinking skills and stretch my skill set as a Software Engineer. In this Repository I created a simple quiz game program using the Kotlin Programming Language. The game is created with the purpose of demonstrating the following: Variables, Expression, Conditionals, Loops, Functions, and Classes. I also added a dictionary and more advanced concepts of the dictionary to get a feel for the documentation. The game starts by prompting the user for their name and then begins to cycle through the questions. If the user gets the question right, it moves on to the next one. If the User gets it wrong, the game prompts to user if they want to see the answers and ends the program. 


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

The tools that I used to create this program was Kotlin and the IntelliJ IDE. It took a while to get used to the IDE. I have only exclusively used VS Code up until this point. It took a few hours, but I was able to get a hang of things and understand how the IDE handled Source Control. I'm glad I was able to learn a new IDE. I have a lot more confidence moving forward with learning another one if the need arises. One piece of code that I imported uses the "exitProcess" command to stop the program from running:

``` import kotlin.system.exitProcess ```

Apart from the IDE and Kotlin, these are the only things I used to develop the game.

# Future Work

* Make it so the User is able to restart the game all over.
* Fix the "show solutions" function - instead of showing all the answers at once, only show the answer that is relevant to where the user is.
* Make the code more re-usable. A lot of the code is repeat functions and actions that take up extra space.
